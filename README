## Overview

This Movable Type plugin allows the manipulation of publishing environment on 
the blog level. By default, MT only allows specifying a single path and URL 
per blog. And in MT5, that path and URL is forced to be subordinate to the 
website. Publishing Paths does two things:

    * Allows you to maintain 3 sets of paths (labeled 'development,' 
      'production,' and 'staging') that you can easily swap between.

    * Allows you to decouple your MT5 blog's paths from the parent website.


## Compatibility

    * MT5
        I developed and tested this with MT5.

    * MT4
        This plugin works in MT4, but the CMS template customizations most 
        certainly will not. This is coming.


## How it Works

It's simple really: The first time you load your blog with this plugin 
installed, we grab your current path and URL and save them as your 'Production 
Environment.' You can also add a 'Development Environment' and 'Staging 
Environment' by going to the plugin settings screen. Once added, you can 
easily switch between environments from the same screen (and in the future, 
from your blog's header). In this way, you can alter where your web site is
published on your server. That's really all there is to it.


## Warning

Please be aware that this plugin permanently alters your blogs publishing 
paths. Disabling the plugin will not revert your settings back to a previous
state. You can easily break your web site if you don't know what you're doing.


## To Do

This plugin will add a dropdown to a blog's header to allow easy switching
between paths without having to go to the plugin settings screen.

This plugin does not address alternate archive paths. I should, and will
correct this if enough interest is expressed.
